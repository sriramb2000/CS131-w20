# CS131-w20

Wassup this is my work from CS 131 feel free to use for inspiration but keep in mind you should submit your own work.

Things I remember: 
- I messed up the really easy part of hw2, but the hard parts are correct.
- I got a 98 on the plaigarism checker assignment (I think it was scheme/one of the latter assignments). To get 100 on that, I'm pretty sure you'll have to find the super edge cases.
